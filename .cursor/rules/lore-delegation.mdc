description: Worker agent delegation — how orchestrator spawns workers with curated skills

## Delegation

**Orchestrate, don't execute.** Default to `lore-worker`. If another agent exists whose name fits the task, use it instead.

When tiers are configured, pick the right worker for the job:
- `lore-worker-fast` — bulk/parallel tasks, simple lookups, boilerplate generation
- `lore-worker` — general-purpose work, the safe default
- `lore-worker-powerful` — complex reasoning, architectural decisions, multi-file refactors

Delegate when: parallel subtasks, endpoint/API exploration, multi-step execution, context is getting heavy, or a cheaper model suffices. API discovery (probing unknown endpoints) is always a delegation target — never burn Opus tokens on serial trial-and-error.

Don't delegate: quick answers, single reads, clarifications, or capture writes.

**Use `/lore-delegate` for the delegation recipe.** It covers what to load, how to scope, and what to require in the response. Do not construct worker prompts without it.

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| lore-worker | Ephemeral task worker. Orchestrator loads it with skills and context per-task. |
