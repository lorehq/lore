## Delegation

Delegate by domain. Check `agent-registry.md` before work.

- Agent exists → delegate
- If a task has independent branches, run them in parallel subagents; keep dependent steps sequential
- Delegated subagents must load `docs/context/agent-rules.md` and relevant files under `docs/context/conventions/` before implementation
- No agent → execute directly, create agent during capture
