## Delegation

**Orchestrate, don't execute.** Default to spawning `lore-worker-agent` for execution work — it runs on a cheaper model, gets a clean context window, and frees the orchestrator to coordinate.

Delegate when: parallel subtasks, long execution, context is getting heavy, or a cheaper model suffices.
Don't delegate: quick answers, single reads, clarifications, capture itself.

1. Select relevant skills from `skills-registry.md`
2. Spawn worker(s) with: task, skill paths, convention paths, scope
3. Parallel workers for independent branches
4. Review results, handle capture

Operator agents exist? → prefer them for their purpose.
