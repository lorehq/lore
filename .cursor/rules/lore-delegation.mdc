description: Worker agent delegation — how orchestrator spawns workers with curated skills

## Delegation

**Orchestrate, don't execute.** Default to `lore-worker-agent`. If another agent exists whose name fits the task, use it instead.

Delegate when: parallel subtasks, long execution, context is getting heavy, or a cheaper model suffices.
Don't delegate: quick answers, single reads, clarifications, capture itself.

Every worker gets conventions (`docs/context/conventions/`) — always, no exceptions. Conventions are constraints on how to work; they apply to every task.

Skills are selective. The orchestrator scans the SKILLS list (in the banner) or `skills-registry.md`, matches skill names and descriptions to the task, and passes relevant skill paths to the worker.

Example — user asks to "write a bash deploy script":

> Task(lore-worker-agent): Write a bash deployment script for the staging environment.
>
> **Load first:**
> - `docs/context/conventions/` (all conventions)
> - `.lore/skills/bash-macos-compat/SKILL.md`
>
> **Scope:** `/home/user/app` — only modify `scripts/deploy.sh`

1. Always include conventions
2. Scan skills for relevance → `bash-macos-compat` matches
3. Spawn worker with task + conventions + matched skills + scope
4. Parallel workers for independent branches
5. Review results, handle capture
