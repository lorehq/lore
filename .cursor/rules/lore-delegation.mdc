description: Worker agent delegation — how orchestrator spawns workers with curated skills

## Delegation

**Orchestrate, don't execute.** Default to `lore-worker-agent`. If another agent exists whose name fits the task, use it instead.

Delegate when: parallel subtasks, long execution, context is getting heavy, or a cheaper model suffices.
Don't delegate: quick answers, single reads, clarifications, capture itself.

Every worker prompt includes three REQUIRED context items:

1. **Agent rules** (`docs/context/agent-rules.md`) — project identity, repo boundaries, behavioral constraints. Without this, workers don't know what repo they're in or what they can modify.
2. **Conventions** (`docs/context/conventions/`) — all convention files. Constraints on how to work; they apply to every task.
3. **Skills** — scan the SKILLS list (in the banner) or `skills-registry.md`, match names and descriptions to the task, include relevant skill paths. If no skills match, say so explicitly.

Then add **scope** — the target repo path and which files the worker may modify.

Example — user asks to "write a bash deploy script":

> Task(lore-worker-agent): Write a bash deployment script for the staging environment.
>
> **Read first (REQUIRED):**
> - `docs/context/agent-rules.md`
> - `docs/context/conventions/` (all files)
> - `.lore/skills/bash-macos-compat/SKILL.md`
>
> **Scope:** `/home/user/app` — only modify `scripts/deploy.sh`

1. Always include agent rules + conventions + matched skills
2. Always specify scope (repo path + files)
3. **CRITICAL: Verify target files belong to the scoped repo.** This is a hub — you work across multiple repos. Before delegating, confirm the files you're modifying actually live in the repo you're scoping to. If they belong elsewhere, scope the worker there instead.
4. Parallel workers for independent branches
5. Review results, handle capture
