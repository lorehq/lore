description: Worker agent delegation — how orchestrator spawns workers with curated skills

## Delegation

**Orchestrate, don't execute.** Default to spawning `lore-worker-agent` for execution work — it runs on a cheaper model, gets a clean context window, and frees the orchestrator to coordinate.

Delegate when: parallel subtasks, long execution, context is getting heavy, or a cheaper model suffices.
Don't delegate: quick answers, single reads, clarifications, capture itself.

The orchestrator selects skills by scanning the SKILLS list (in the banner) or `skills-registry.md`. Match skill names and descriptions to the task, then pass their file paths to the worker.

Example — user asks to "write a bash deploy script":

> Task(lore-worker-agent): Write a bash deployment script for the staging environment.
>
> **Load first:**
> - `.lore/skills/bash-macos-compat/SKILL.md`
> - `docs/context/conventions/coding.md`
>
> **Scope:** `/home/user/app` — only modify `scripts/deploy.sh`

1. Scan skills for relevance → `bash-macos-compat` matches
2. Spawn worker with task + skill paths + conventions + scope
3. Parallel workers for independent branches
4. Review results, handle capture

Operator agents exist? → prefer them for their purpose.
