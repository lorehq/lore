description: Worker agent delegation — how orchestrator spawns workers with curated skills

## Delegation

One framework worker: `lore-worker`. The orchestrator spawns it per-task with curated skills, conventions, and scope — the orchestrator's context is too valuable for execution details.

Operator agents are optional. Create when a static, reusable delegation pattern is valuable — naming: `<purpose>-agent`.

When tiers are configured, pick the right worker:
- `lore-worker-fast` — bulk/parallel tasks, simple lookups, boilerplate
- `lore-worker` — general-purpose work, the safe default
- `lore-worker-powerful` — complex reasoning, architectural decisions, multi-file refactors

Delegate when: parallel subtasks, API exploration, multi-step execution, heavy context, or a cheaper model suffices. Keep in the orchestrator: quick answers, single reads, clarifications, capture writes.

Name conventions and skills for workers in the prompt — they read the files. Load `/lore-delegate` before constructing any worker prompt — it defines the required structure.

`subagentDefaults` in `.lore/config.json`:

```json
"subagentDefaults": {
  "claude": { "fast": "haiku", "default": "sonnet", "powerful": "opus" },
  "opencode": { "fast": "openai/gpt-5-codex-mini", "default": "openai/gpt-5.2-codex", "powerful": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex" },
  "cursor": { "fast": "haiku", "default": "sonnet", "powerful": "opus" }
}
```

When configured, `lore sync` generates Claude worker variants: `lore-worker.md` (default), `lore-worker-fast.md`, `lore-worker-powerful.md`. OpenCode and Cursor tiers are informational — read from config at runtime.

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| lore-worker | Ephemeral task worker. Orchestrator loads it with skills and context per-task. |
