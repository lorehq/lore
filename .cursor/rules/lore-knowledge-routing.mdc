## Capture

Before writing to `docs/`, creating skills, or updating work items — propose what and where, then wait for operator approval.

Capture targets:
- Reusable fix → create or update a skill
- Environment fact (URL, endpoint, service, auth, redirect) → `docs/knowledge/environment/`
- Multi-step procedure → `docs/knowledge/runbooks/`
- Neither → state "No capture needed" with a one-line reason

Discovery failures are normal noise — execution failures are high-signal and require a capture decision.

After substantive work, also check: skills over 80 lines or mixing methods → split. Run `.lore/scripts/validate-consistency.sh`. Active plan or roadmap → update progress.

Use `/lore-capture` for a full checklist. `/lore-consolidate` for deep health checks.
