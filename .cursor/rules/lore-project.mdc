# Agent Rules

<!-- Injected into every agent session as PROJECT context. -->
<!-- Customize with your project identity and behavior rules. -->
<!-- Coding conventions belong in docs/context/conventions.md — also injected. -->

## About

Describe your project — what it is, what repos are involved, key constraints.

## Agent Behavior

Rules for how the agent should operate in this instance.

# Conventions

Operational rules and standards for this environment. Each page covers a specific domain.

# Coding

Add your coding rules here — standards the agent should follow when writing code.

# Docs

## Formatting

- **Checkboxes** (`- [x]`/`- [ ]`) for all actionable items: scope, deliverables, success criteria
- **Strikethrough** (`~~text~~`) on completed item text: `- [x] ~~Done item~~`
- **No emoji icons** — no checkmarks, no colored circles, no decorative symbols
- **Blank line before lists** — required for MkDocs to render lists correctly
