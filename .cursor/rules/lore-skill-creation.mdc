## Skill Creation

**Every gotcha becomes a skill. No exceptions.** 30-80 lines, generic only — no context data (usernames, URLs, account IDs go in `docs/knowledge/environment/`).

One skill per interaction method (API, CLI, MCP, SDK, UI). Over 80 lines → split by concern.

Naming: `<service>-<action>-<object>`. Only use `lore-` prefix for framework commands. See `.lore/skills/lore-create-skill/SKILL.md`.

## Agent Creation

**Domain = Agent (1:1). No orphaned skills.** Create immediately when skill has clear domain, even with 1 skill.

Naming: `lore-<domain-slug>-agent` for framework agents, `<domain-slug>-agent` for operator agents. See `.lore/skills/lore-create-agent/SKILL.md`.

Per-platform model preferences go on agents (not skills). Set `claude-model`, `opencode-model`, `cursor-model` in agent frontmatter. Instance defaults live in `.lore-config` under `subagentDefaults`.
