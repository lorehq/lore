## Agent Creation

**Domain = Agent (1:1).** A domain earns an agent when multiple skills cluster around the same tool, making delegation valuable. A single skill doesn't warrant a domain or agent — it stays in Orchestrator until more skills cluster.

The domain name is the **tool name** — the specific tool at the bottom of the call stack, not a category. Examples: `git-agent`, `mkdocs-agent`, `docker-compose-agent` — not "VCS agent" or "Documentation agent".

Naming: `lore-<tool-name>-agent` for framework agents, `<tool-name>-agent` for operator agents. See `.lore/skills/lore-create-agent/SKILL.md`.

`lore-*` skills with `type: command` in frontmatter are framework commands (e.g., `lore-capture`, `lore-create-skill`), not domain knowledge. They always belong to Orchestrator and don't count toward domain clustering.

Per-platform model preferences go on agents (not skills). Set `claude-model`, `opencode-model`, `cursor-model` in agent frontmatter. Instance defaults live in `.lore-config` under `subagentDefaults`.
