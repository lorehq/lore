## Knowledge

**Every gotcha becomes a skill. No exceptions.** 30-80 lines, generic only — no context data (usernames, URLs, account IDs go in `docs/knowledge/environment/`).

One skill per interaction method (API, CLI, MCP, SDK, UI). Over 80 lines → split by concern.

Naming: `<service>-<action>-<object>`. Only use `lore-` prefix for framework commands.

Actively map the environment as you encounter it. When you interact with a URL, service, account, API, or infrastructure component — check if it's already documented. If not, add it to `docs/knowledge/environment/`. Don't wait for capture.

## Agent Creation

**One framework worker: `lore-worker-agent`.** The orchestrator spawns it per-task with curated skills, conventions, and scope.

Operator agents are optional. Create them when a static, reusable delegation pattern is valuable — naming: `<purpose>-agent`.

Per-platform model preferences go on agents (not skills). Set `claude-model`, `opencode-model`, `cursor-model` in agent frontmatter. Instance defaults live in `.lore-config` under `subagentDefaults`.
