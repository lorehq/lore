## Agent Creation

**Domain = Agent (1:1). No orphaned skills.** Create immediately when skill has clear domain, even with 1 skill.

Naming: `lore-<domain-slug>-agent` for framework agents, `<domain-slug>-agent` for operator agents. See `.lore/skills/lore-create-agent/SKILL.md`.

Per-platform model preferences go on agents (not skills). Set `claude-model`, `opencode-model`, `cursor-model` in agent frontmatter. Instance defaults live in `.lore-config` under `subagentDefaults`.
