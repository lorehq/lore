## Knowledge

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Operator identity, preferences | `docs/knowledge/local/operator-profile.md` (gitignored) |
| Gotchas (auth quirks, encoding, parameter tricks) | `.lore/skills/` via lore-create-skill |
| Rules, conventions | `docs/context/` |
| Environment (URLs, repos, services, relationships) | `docs/knowledge/environment/` |
| Procedures (multi-step operations) | `docs/knowledge/runbooks/` |
| Scratch notes (temporary) | `.lore/memory.local.md` (gitignored) |

`MEMORY.md` is intercepted by hooks and blocked — use the routes above.

Every gotcha becomes a skill. Propose the name and a one-line summary; create after operator approval. 30-80 lines, generic only — context data (usernames, URLs, account IDs) goes in `docs/knowledge/environment/`. One skill per interaction method (API, CLI, MCP, SDK, UI). Over 80 lines → split by concern. Naming: `<service>-<action>-<object>`. Reserve `lore-` prefix for framework commands.

Actively map the environment. When you interact with a URL, service, account, or API — check if it's documented. If not, propose adding it to `docs/knowledge/environment/`. Write after operator approval.
