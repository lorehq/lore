## Work Management

Roadmaps, plans, and brainstorms — all **operator-initiated** (Lore never creates them unprompted).

- **Roadmaps** (`docs/work/roadmaps/<slug>/`): Strategic initiatives (weeks to months). Contain nested `plans/` and `archive/` folders.
- **Plans** (`docs/work/plans/<slug>/` or `docs/work/roadmaps/<roadmap>/plans/<slug>/`): Tactical work (days to weeks). Standalone or nested under a roadmap.
- **Brainstorms** (`docs/work/brainstorms/<slug>/`): Conversation artifacts for future reference. No `status` field — not tracked work.

Roadmaps and plans use YAML frontmatter (`status: active`) and active items appear in the session banner. Completed items move to `archive/` subfolders.

## Cursor Plans vs Lore Plans

Plans that should persist across sessions use `/lore-create-plan` and live in
`docs/work/plans/` or under a roadmap. Cursor's built-in `.cursor/plans/` is for
throwaway session-scoped implementation checklists only.

When the operator asks to "create a plan", default to Lore's system unless the
task is clearly a one-off implementation checklist that won't outlive the session.
