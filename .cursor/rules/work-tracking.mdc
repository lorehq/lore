# Work Tracking

Plans that should persist across sessions use `/lore-create-plan` and live in `docs/work/plans/` or under a roadmap. Cursor's built-in `.cursor/plans/` is for throwaway session-scoped implementation checklists only.

When the operator asks to "create a plan", default to Lore's system unless the task is clearly a one-off implementation checklist that won't outlive the session.
