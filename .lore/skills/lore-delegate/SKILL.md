# Delegation Recipe

## Worker Prompt Rules

Name what to load — workers read the files themselves.

Include in every worker prompt:
1. **Knowledge-base-first** — "Search the knowledge base before acting (semantic search if available, otherwise Glob/Grep)." This prevents redundant discovery and surfaces existing skills/knowledge early.
2. **Task description** — what needs doing and why
3. **Resolve before delegating** — Workers execute, they don't interpret. Resolve ambiguous or relative inputs to concrete values before they reach the worker. If it requires reasoning or judgment, the orchestrator decides; the worker receives the decision.
   - Bad: "find large files" → worker decides what "large" means
   - Good: "find files over 10MB" → worker executes a clear threshold
   - Bad: "get recent orders" → worker interprets "recent"
   - Good: "get orders with status pending" → worker filters on a concrete field
4. **Conventions to load** — name any from `docs/context/` the worker needs (e.g. `coding`, `security`); worker reads the files
5. **Scope** — target repo path, which files may be modified
6. **Bail-out rule** — "If stuck after 10 tool calls, stop and return what you have — the orchestrator can redirect."
7. **Return contract** — "End with a Captures section: (A) Gotchas, (B) Environment facts, (C) Procedures — or 'none' for each."

You may also name specific skills to load — workers discover the rest via semantic search.

Workers report findings — the orchestrator decides what to persist.

## Parallel Workers

For independent subtasks, spawn parallel workers. Don't serialize what can run concurrently.

## After Worker Returns

1. Gotchas reported? → create skill
2. Environment facts? → write to `docs/knowledge/environment/`
3. Procedures? → write to `docs/knowledge/runbooks/`
4. Nothing? → move on
