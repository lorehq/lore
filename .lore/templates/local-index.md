# Local Notes

This folder is gitignored — anything here stays local to your machine.

Use it for scratch notes, credentials references, personal bookmarks, or
anything you don't want committed to the shared repo.

This folder shows up in nav and the knowledge path guide like any other
section, but git won't track its contents.
