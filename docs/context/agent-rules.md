# Agent Rules

<!-- Injected into every agent session as PROJECT context. -->
<!-- Customize with your project identity, behavior rules, and coding standards. -->

## About

Describe your project — what it is, what repos are involved, key constraints.

## Agent Behavior

Rules for how the agent should operate in this instance.

## Conventions

Coding patterns, naming standards, tooling preferences.

## Coding Rules

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
