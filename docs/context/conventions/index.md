# Conventions

<!-- Injected into every agent session as CONVENTIONS context. -->

Naming standards, formatting rules, and patterns for this environment.

## Docs Formatting

- **Checkboxes** (`- [x]`/`- [ ]`) for all actionable items: scope, deliverables, success criteria
- **Strikethrough** (`~~text~~`) on completed item text: `- [x] ~~Done item~~`
- **No emoji icons** — no checkmarks, no colored circles, no decorative symbols
- **Blank line before lists** — required for MkDocs to render lists correctly

## Commit Messages

- Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "what"
- Include `Co-Authored-By` trailer when agent-assisted
