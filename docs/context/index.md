# Context

Rules and conventions injected into every agent session. This is the "always-on" configuration — what the agent must know before doing anything.

Reference material (environment details, runbooks, scratch notes) lives in [Knowledge](../knowledge/index.md).

## Default Structure

- **Agent Rules** — project identity and behavior rules
- **Conventions** — coding standards, docs formatting, team norms
