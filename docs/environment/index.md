# Environment

Operational knowledge about the systems, services, and conventions you work with. This section is yours to organize — add subdirectories that match your domain.

## Default Structure

- **Systems** — repos, services, infrastructure, accounts
- **Conventions** — naming standards, workflows, team norms
- **Diagrams** — architecture, topology, data flow

See the [Customizing Environment](../guides/customizing-environment.md) guide for advanced configuration.
