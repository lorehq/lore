# Customization

## Agent Rules

`docs/context/agent-rules.md` is injected into every agent session as the PROJECT context. Put your project identity and behavior rules here.

The file is **sticky** — if deleted, the session hook recreates it with a skeleton template (About, Agent Behavior sections) on next startup.

Coding standards go in `docs/context/conventions/` — a directory with per-domain pages (`coding.md`, `docs.md`). Conventions are also injected every session. Both are sticky and recreated if deleted.

This replaces what you'd normally put in `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursor/rules/` — but lives in docs where it's browsable and version-controlled.

## Conventions

`docs/context/conventions/` holds behavioral rules the agent follows when writing files. Each `.md` file is one convention. Convention names are listed before every user message to keep them discoverable, and a write-time guard reinforces relevant principles before every file write based on the target path — security fires on every write, docs fires for `docs/` paths, and so on. Remaining conventions are listed as a menu so the agent can self-serve.

To add a custom convention, drop a markdown file in the directory. Use bold principle lines (`**Like this.**`) — the guard extracts these for write-time reminders. No hook changes needed.

## Context vs Knowledge

`docs/context/` holds rules and conventions injected every session (agent-rules, coding standards). `docs/knowledge/` holds reference material loaded on-demand (environment details, runbooks, scratch notes).

Both directories are yours to organize — the default structures are starting points, not constraints.

**Adding a section:** Create a directory with markdown files. Use kebab-case for directory names — `ensure-structure.sh` runs at session start and creates missing `index.md` files automatically. If using Docker, nav regenerates on file changes via the watcher.

**Removing a section:** Delete the directory. Docker's watcher picks up the change automatically.

**Auto-scaffold:** Directories without `index.md` get one created from the orphan template (`.lore/templates/orphan-index.md`) at session start and during Docker rebuilds.

## Local Notes

The `docs/knowledge/local/` directory is gitignored. Use it for scratch notes, credentials references, or anything you don't want committed. It's sticky — recreated on session start if deleted.

## Nav Generation

Nav is generated by Docker at runtime (`runtime/nav_generator.py`). Structure enforcement (`ensure-structure.sh`) runs automatically at session start — there's no manual nav step needed.
