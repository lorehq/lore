# Lore

Knowledge-persistent coding agent framework. Hooks, skills, agents, and docs that compound across sessions.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-lore my-project
cd my-project
claude
```

## Core Principles

**Self-Learning** — Captures gotchas as reusable skills, maps your environment through docs. The agent adapts to your specific setup every session.

**Delegation** — Orchestrator dispatches domain work to cheaper, focused agents. Less token spend, cleaner context windows.

**Work Continuity** — Roadmaps and plans persist across sessions. Active work surfaces every startup.
