# Environment

Organized details about the systems, services, and infrastructure you work with. Add subdirectories that match your domain — use kebab-case for directory names (`my-section`, not `my_section`).

## Default Structure

- **Systems** — repos, services, infrastructure, databases
- **Architecture** — diagrams, topology, data flow
- **Accounts** — orgs, cloud providers, identity
- **Integrations** — third-party APIs, webhooks, SDKs
- **Operations** — CI/CD, monitoring, deployment
