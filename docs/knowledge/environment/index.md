# Environment

Details about the systems, services, and infrastructure you work with. Add subdirectories that match your domain — use kebab-case for directory names (`my-section`, not `my_section`).

## Default Structure

- **Inventory** — repos, accounts, orgs, services
- **Decisions** — strategic choices with rationale
- **Reference** — configuration fields, env vars
- **Diagrams** — architecture, topology, data flow
