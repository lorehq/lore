# Knowledge

Reference material about your environment, systems, and operations. Loaded on-demand — not injected every session.

## Default Structure

- **Environment** — systems, architecture, accounts, integrations, operations
- **Runbooks** — multi-step operational procedures
- **`local/`** — local-only notes, gitignored (never committed)

See the [Customization](../guides/customization.md) guide for advanced configuration.
