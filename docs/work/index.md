# Work

Operator-initiated roadmaps, plans, and brainstorms.

- **Roadmaps** — strategic initiatives (weeks to months)
- **Plans** — tactical work (days to weeks), standalone or nested under a roadmap
- **Brainstorms** — conversation artifacts for future reference

Use `/create-roadmap`, `/create-plan`, or `/create-brainstorm` to get started.
